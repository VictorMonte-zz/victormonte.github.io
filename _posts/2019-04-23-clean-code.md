Firstly, I believe that ever knowlegde should help you, whether you are prepare to understand/use or not. Also, I couldn't achieve this conclusion about the book without reading it. So, I'm writing my opinnion after finished the book.

# Why should you read ?

Developers are always looking for self improvement inside software engineer world and this isn't new. I know that there are a lot of concerns that a developer should care about, however the code legibility is one of them. 

For sure, the best developers are the ones who care about how the code is speaking the business's purpouse. That legibility when done correctly can help others developers to create new features or even execute a debug to find a bug.

This book is about how you improve your code for better understanding. If you notice that you need to improve your code's understanding or even review your thoughts about code style, you probably should put this book into your list.

Its clear for me that it's a book that may be difficult for new developers. The experience gained in some projects should help visualize how the author's solution it really makes sense.

# About the book

The book is fulfilled with the experience of the author Robert Martin and since the beginning of the book. You can read how the authors thinks about how clean code can be done and also his code philosophy. 
Its very gratifying see his expirence through the pages.

Beyond the author's experiences you can see also some code samples. Robert puts some interesting comments to make the reader think about it like "It this the best approach", "Why the lack of clean code into these lines slows you down?".

There is a structure created by Martin that enumerates the good practices and help you to see clear all of it. A compile version of the themes I put above.

* Comments
* Environments
* Functions
* General points
    - Duplicationm
    - Overrides
    - Excess of Information
    - Inapropriated stuff
    - Switch statements
* Java
* Tests

It also adds some information about Domain Driven Design, Test Driven Development, Dont Repeat Yourself(DRY) and more. It's not so deep into these subjects but it makes a good link between all of them and the Clean Code. The relations between them and the develivery of business value.
